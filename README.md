# Base Development Website
---

## About

The goal of this repo is to create a baseline website that has the following:

- Basic styling.
- Some sort of Database access.
- A method of user authentication.
- An easy path for extension.
- All without being extremely heavy or obtuse.

## Components

The website will be developed on top of python/Flask. You can get more information on Flask [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/).
For styling, the base website will use [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/).


## Getting up and running

It is not possible with this repository right now. I will update the README when it is.
